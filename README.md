# Remote Work Distribution Platform

## Overview
This project was developed during the hackathon conducted at NITK Surathkal College. It's a platform aimed at facilitating remote work distribution within a company. The system allows the webmaster or company owner to notify the platform about new projects. The platform, built using Flutter for the frontend web UI and Django REST for the backend, then manages the distribution of work among different developers within the company.

## Features
- **Project Management**: New projects can be added to the platform by the webmaster or company owner.
